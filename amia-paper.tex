\section{UMLS SOURCES TO PICO TARGETS}\label{lss}
%==============================
%
The UMLS concepts are organized under semantic type categories, an internal semantic ontology provided by UMLS.
These semantic categories or types were mapped to the PICO targets as defined in Table~\ref{tab:source2target} along with the justification for the mapping.

\section{EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS}\label{params}
%==============================
%
All the code was written in Python v3.8.
The label model was initialized with a cardinality of two for positive and negative labels for each target class. 
Snorkel v0.9.7 was used to train the label model.
GridSearch was used to tune the parameters.
The parameters used to tune the Snorkel label model are listed in Table~\ref{lm:params}.

All the NER experiments in this article were conducted in PyTorch v1.9.0, and the models were trained for 15 epochs with a mini-batch size of 10 for training and 6 for evaluation.
The maximum sequence length was set to 510 because of the transformer's limit.
For weakly and fully supervised experiments, the EBM-PICO training set was divided, 80\% of the data was used for training and 20\% for development.
The [CLS] embeddings from the PubMedBERT layer were used as features of the input text.
PubMedBERT was fine-tuned by not freezing weights during the experiments.
ReLU was used as the activation function before feeding [CLS] outputs to the linear layer.
The gradients were clipped to 1.0 to mitigate the problem of exploding gradients.
Each experiment was carried out on a single Quadro RTX 6000 GPU without data and model parallelization.
Further parameters used to train the weakly supervised PubMedBERT model are listed in Table~\ref{ws:params}.
